    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="section-split--right text-lockup">
    <p> After integrating a feature-rich assessment authoring platform, LearnZillion broke free from only being able to have one item per question. Instead, a single question could now have multiple parts which could be any combination of auto-graded and/or manually graded.</p>
    <p>We needed a way to quickly let see teachers how their classes are doing, while allowing them to easily see which questions required their attention.</p>

    <h3>What obstacles stood in the way?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reports listed all students together. This made it difficult
        for teachers to distinguish how their individual classrooms were
        performing.
      </li>
      <li>Assignment questions can now be multi-part. How do we display
        completion, scoring, and need for manual grading?
